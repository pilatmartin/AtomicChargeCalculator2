# Integrations
Integrations serve as a *low level* layer providing access to ChargeFW2 and filesystem. They are then used in [services](../../../src/backend/app/services/). The goal was to decouple these implementations from services, hopefully making future replacement easier (e.g., not using Python bindings anymore).
