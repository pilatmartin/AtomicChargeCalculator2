# Components
This module contains the components used in all pages.

## ui
[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) components are stored in [ui directory](../../../src/frontend/acc2/src/components/ui/). You can adjust them as you wish as they are a part of this codebase and only depend on the radix-ui library.

Shadcn components can be added using the following command defined in [package.json](../../../src/frontend/acc2/package.json):

```bash
$ pnpm ui:add <component-name>
```
